# Leptonica Sudoku

[Leptonica](https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica), the image processing
and analysis C library, has a [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku)
[module](https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica/blob/master/src/sudoku.c).
It's not clear to me why, but nonetheless I wrote bindings to it.

It can solve a Sudoku puzzle, and generate new ones.
